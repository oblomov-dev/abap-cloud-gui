# report2cloud: ZR2C_02_FLIGHTS → z2ui5_cl_cgui_r2c_02

| | |
|---|---|
| Source | `zr2c_02_flights.prog.abap` |
| Text pool | `zr2c_02_flights.prog.xml` |
| Result | **converted** - `z2ui5_cl_cgui_r2c_02.clas.abap`, `z2ui5_cl_cgui_r2c_02.clas.xml` |
| Mapped | 39 construct(s) |
| TODO | 1 |
| Release state to check | 2 object(s) |

## TODO

- `zr2c_02_flights.prog.abap:43:1` - TOP-OF-PAGE: the header is written before the first line of the list and after each NEW-PAGE - not at every page break; sy-pagno is not set

## Release state on ABAP Cloud

ABAP Cloud only allows released objects. Check each one; the successor is a hint, not a guarantee.

| Object | Kind | First use | Released successor (hint) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SFLIGHT` | database table | `z2ui5_cl_cgui_r2c_02.clas.abap:10:23` | /DMO/FLIGHT (ABAP Flight Reference Scenario) or a released CDS view of your own |
| `ZR2C` | message class | - | - |

## Not carried over

Layout, formatting and behaviour of the classic report that the list, the ALV or the selection screen of abap-cloud-gui do not have:

- WRITE ... CURRENCY - the list writes the value in its default format

## Next steps

1. Work through the TODOs above; replace every object of the release table by its released successor.
2. Lint the class against ABAP Cloud: `node tools/report2cloud/cli.mjs <report> --check` (or `npm run check:cloud` with the class in `src/`) until it is clean.
3. Check the views with the abap2UI5 linter (`npx abap2ui5lint`) and run the report: `?app_start=z2ui5_cl_cgui_r2c_02`.
4. Pin the behaviour with ABAP Unit tests before the next change.
